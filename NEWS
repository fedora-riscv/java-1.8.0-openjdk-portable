Notes on individual issues:
===========================

security-libs/org.ietf.jgss:krb5:

JDK-8029995: accept yes/no for boolean krb5.conf settings
=========================================================
The krb5.conf configuration file now also accepts "yes" and "no", as
alternatives to the existing "true" and "false" support, when using
settings that take boolean values.

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8312489: Increase jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize default which is too low for JARs such as WhiteSource/Mend unified agent jar
===============================================================================================================================
A maximum signature file size property, jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize,
was introduced in the 8u382 release of OpenJDK by JDK-8300596, with a
default of 8MB. This default proved to be too small for some JAR
files. This release, 8u402, increases it to 16MB.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

other-libs/corba:idl:

JDK-8303384: Improved communication in CORBA
============================================
The JDK's CORBA implementation now provides the option to limit
serialisation in stub objects to those with the "IOR:" prefix.  For
ORB constrained stub classes:

* _DynArrayStub
* _DynEnumStub
* _DynFixedStub
* _DynSequenceStub
* _DynStructStub
* _DynUnionStub
* _DynValueStub
* _DynAnyStub
* _DynAnyFactoryStub

this is enabled by default and may be disabled by setting the system
property org.omg.DynamicAny.disableIORCheck to 'true'.

For remote service stub classes:

* _NamingContextStub
* _BindingIteratorStub
* _NamingContextExtStub
* _ServantActivatorStub
* _ServantLocatorStub
* _ServerManagerStub
* _ActivatorStub
* _RepositoryStub
* _InitialNameServiceStub
* _LocatorStub
* _ServerStub

it is disabled by default and may be enabled by setting the system
property org.omg.CORBA.IDL.Stubs.enableIORCheck to 'true'.

security-libs/org.ietf.jgss:

JDK-6722928: Added a Default Native GSS-API Library on Windows
==============================================================

A native GSS-API library named `sspi_bridge.dll` has been added to the
JDK on the Windows platform.  As with native GSS-API library provision
on other operating systems, it will only be loaded when the
`sun.security.jgss.native` system property is set to "true". A user
can still load a third-party native GSS-API library instead by setting
the `sun.security.jgss.lib` system property to the appropriate path.

The library is client-side only and uses the default credentials.
Native GSS support automatically uses cached credentials from the
underlying operating system, so the
`javax.security.auth.useSubjectCredsOnly` system property should be
set to false.

The `com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule` does not call
native JGSS and so its use in your JAAS config should be avoided.

security-libs/org.ietf.jgss:krb5:

JDK-8139348: Deprecate 3DES and RC4 in Kerberos
===============================================
The `des3-hmac-sha1` and `rc4-hmac` Kerberos encryption types (etypes)
are now deprecated and disabled by default.  To re-enable them, you
can either enable all weak crypto (which also includes `des-cbc-crc`
and `des-cbc-md5`) by setting `allow_weak_crypto = true` in the
`krb5.conf` configuration file or explicitly list all the preferred
encryption types using the `default_tkt_enctypes`,
`default_tgs_enctypes`, or `permitted_enctypes` settings.

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8295894: Removed SECOM Trust System's RootCA1 Root Certificate
==================================================================
The following root certificate from SECOM Trust System has been
removed from the `cacerts` keystore:

Alias Name: secomscrootca1 [jdk]
Distinguished Name: OU=Security Communication RootCA1, O=SECOM Trust.net, C=JP

JDK-8314960: Added Certigna Root CA Certificate
===============================================
The following root certificate has been added to the cacerts
truststore:

Name: Certigna (Dhimyotis)
Alias Name: certignarootca
Distinguished Name: CN=Certigna Root CA, OU=0002 48146308100036, O=Dhimyotis, C=FR

security-libs/javax.security:

JDK-8242330: Arrays should be cloned in several JAAS Callback classes
=====================================================================
In the JAAS classes, ChoiceCallback and ConfirmationCallback, arrays
were not cloned when passed into a constructor or returned. This
allowed an external program to get access to the internal fields of
these classes. The classes have been updated to return cloned arrays.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

core-libs/java.lang:

JDK-8305681: Allow additional characters for GB18030-2022 (Level 2) support
===========================================================================
In order to support "Implementation Level 2" of the GB18030-2022
standard, the JDK must be able to use characters from the CJK Unified
Ideographs Extension E block of Unicode 8.0.  The addition of these
characters forms Maintenance Release 5 of the Java SE 8 specification,
which is implemented in this release of OpenJDK via the addition of a
new UnicodeBlock instance,
Character.CJK_UNIFIED_IDEOGRAPHS_EXTENSION_E.

core-libs/java.util.jar:

8300596: Enhance Jar Signature validation
=========================================
A System property "jdk.jar.maxSignatureFileSize" is introduced to
configure the maximum number of bytes allowed for the
signature-related files in a JAR file during verification. The default
value is 8000000 bytes (8 MB).

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

hotspot:
core-libs:

JDK-8305562: Cgroups v2: Container awareness
============================================
The HotSpot runtime code as well as the core libraries code in the JDK
has been updated in order to detect a cgroup v2 host system when
running OpenJDK within a Linux container.

Since the 8u202 release of OpenJDK, the container detection code
recognized cgroup v1 (legacy) host Linux systems. With 8u372 and later
releases, both versions of the underlying cgroups pseudo filesystem
will be detected and corresponding container limits applied to the
OpenJDK runtime.

Without this enhancement, OpenJDK would not apply container resource
limits when running on a cgroup v2 Linux host system, but would use
the underlying hosts' resource limits instead.

client-libs/javax.swing:

JDK-8296832: Improve Swing platform support
===========================================
Earlier OpenJDK releases would always render HTML object tags embedded in
Swing HTML components. With this release, rendering only occurs when the
new system property "swing.html.object" is set to true. By default, it
is set to false.

core-svc/javax.management:

JDK-8234484: Added Ability to Configure Third Port for Remote JMX
=================================================================
A local access port can now be configured for JMX connections by
setting the property `com.sun.management.jmxremote.local.port`. This
local port was previously selected at random, which could lead to port
collisions. The property works in the same way as the existing
properties for configuring the remote access port
(`com.sun.management.jmxremote.port`) and the RMI port
(`com.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port`)

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8245654: Added Certigna(Dhimyotis) Root CA Certificate
==========================================================
The following root certificate has been added to the cacerts truststore:

Name: Certigna (Dhimyotis)
Alias Name: certignarootca
Distinguished Name: CN=Certigna, O=Dhimyotis, C=FR

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

client-libs/javax.imageio:

JDK-8295687: Better BMP bounds
==============================
Loading a linked ICC profile within a BMP image is now disabled by
default. To re-enable it, set the new system property
`sun.imageio.bmp.enabledLinkedProfiles` to `true`.  This new property
replaces the old property,
`sun.imageio.plugins.bmp.disableLinkedProfiles`.

client-libs/javax.sound:

JDK-8293742: Better Banking of Sounds
=====================================
Previously, the SoundbankReader implementation,
`com.sun.media.sound.JARSoundbankReader`, would download a JAR
soundbank from a URL.  This behaviour is now disabled by default. To
re-enable it, set the new system property `jdk.sound.jarsoundbank` to
`true`.

hotspot/runtime:

JDK-8274840: Release Now Recognises Windows 11
==============================================
This release now correctly sets the `os.name` property to `Windows
11`, as would be expected.

other-libs/corba:idl:

JDK-8285021: Improve CORBA communication
========================================
The JDK's CORBA implementation now refuses by default to deserialize
objects, unless they have the "IOR:" prefix.  The previous behaviour
can be re-enabled by setting the new property
`com.sun.CORBA.ORBAllowDeserializeObject` to `true`.

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8269039: Disabled SHA-1 Signed JARs
=======================================
JARs signed with SHA-1 algorithms are now restricted by default and
treated as if they were unsigned. This applies to the algorithms used
to digest, sign, and optionally timestamp the JAR. It also applies to
the signature and digest algorithms of the certificates in the
certificate chain of the code signer and the Timestamp Authority, and
any CRLs or OCSP responses that are used to verify if those
certificates have been revoked. These restrictions also apply to
signed JCE providers.

To reduce the compatibility risk for JARs that have been previously
timestamped, there is one exception to this policy:

- Any JAR signed with SHA-1 algorithms and timestamped prior to
  January 01, 2019 will not be restricted.

This exception may be removed in a future JDK release. To determine if
your signed JARs are affected by this change, run:

$ jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs`

on the signed JAR, and look for instances of "SHA1" or "SHA-1" and
"disabled" and a warning that the JAR will be treated as unsigned in
the output.

For example:

   Signed by "CN="Signer""
   Digest algorithm: SHA-1 (disabled)
   Signature algorithm: SHA1withRSA (disabled), 2048-bit key

   WARNING: The jar will be treated as unsigned, because it is signed with a weak algorithm that is now disabled by the security property:

   jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024, DSA keySize < 1024, SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01

JARs affected by these new restrictions should be replaced or
re-signed with stronger algorithms.

Users can, *at their own risk*, remove these restrictions by modifying
the `java.security` configuration file (or override it by using the
`java.security.properties` system property) and removing "SHA1 usage
SignedJAR & denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the
`jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms` security property and "SHA1
denyAfter 2019-01-01" from the `jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms` security
property.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

core-libs/java.lang:

JDK-8201793: (ref) Reference object should not support cloning
==============================================================
`java.lang.ref.Reference::clone` method always throws
`CloneNotSupportedException`. `Reference` objects cannot be
meaningfully cloned. To create a new Reference object, call the
constructor to create a `Reference` object with the same referent and
reference queue instead.

JDK-8175797: (ref) Reference::enqueue method should clear the reference object before enqueuing
===============================================================================================
`java.lang.ref.Reference.enqueue` method clears the reference object
before it is added to the registered queue. When the `enqueue` method
is called, the reference object is cleared and `get()` method will
return null in OpenJDK 8u352.

Typically when a reference object is enqueued, it is expected that the
reference object is cleared explicitly via the `clear` method to avoid
memory leak because its referent is no longer referenced. In other
words the `get` method is expected not to be called in common cases
once the `enqueue`method is called. In the case when the `get` method
from an enqueued reference object and existing code attempts to access
members of the referent, `NullPointerException` may be thrown. Such
code will need to be updated.

JDK-8071507: (ref) Clear phantom reference as soft and weak references do
=========================================================================
This enhancement changes phantom references to be automatically
cleared by the garbage collector as soft and weak references.

An object becomes phantom reachable after it has been finalized. This
change may cause the phantom reachable objects to be GC'ed earlier -
previously the referent is kept alive until PhantomReference objects
are GC'ed or cleared by the application. This potential behavioral
change might only impact existing code that would depend on
PhantomReference being enqueued rather than when the referent be freed
from the heap.

core-libs/java.net:

JDK-8286918: Better HttpServer service
======================================
The HttpServer can be optionally configured with a maximum connection
limit by setting the jdk.httpserver.maxConnections system property. A
value of 0 or a negative integer is ignored and considered to
represent no connection limit. In the case of a positive integer
value, any newly accepted connections will be first checked against
the current count of established connections and, if the configured
limit has been reached, then the newly accepted connection will be
closed immediately.

security-libs/javax.net.ssl:

JDK-8282859: Enable TLSv1.3 by Default on JDK 8 for Client Roles
================================================================
The TLSv1.3 implementation is now enabled by default for client roles
in 8u352. It has been enabled by default for server roles since 8u272.

Note that TLS 1.3 is not directly compatible with previous
versions. Enabling it on the client may introduce compatibility issues
on either the server or the client side. Here are some more details on
potential compatibility issues that you should be aware of:

* TLS 1.3 uses a half-close policy, while TLS 1.2 and prior versions
  use a duplex-close policy. For applications that depend on the
  duplex-close policy, there may be compatibility issues when
  upgrading to TLS 1.3.

* The signature_algorithms_cert extension requires that pre-defined
  signature algorithms are used for certificate authentication. In
  practice, however, an application may use non-supported signature
  algorithms.

* The DSA signature algorithm is not supported in TLS 1.3. If a server
  is configured to only use DSA certificates, it cannot upgrade to TLS
  1.3.

* The supported cipher suites for TLS 1.3 are not the same as TLS 1.2
  and prior versions. If an application hard-codes cipher suites which
  are no longer supported, it may not be able to use TLS 1.3 without
  modifying the application code.

* The TLS 1.3 session resumption and key update behaviors are
  different from TLS 1.2 and prior versions. The compatibility should
  be minimal, but it could be a risk if an application depends on the
  handshake details of the TLS protocols.

The TLS 1.3 protocol can be disabled by using the jdk.tls.client.protocols
system property:

java -Djdk.tls.client.protocols="TLSv1.2" ...

Alternatively, an application can explicitly set the enabled protocols
with the javax.net.ssl APIs e.g.

sslSocket.setEnabledProtocols(new String[] {"TLSv1.2"});

or:

SSLParameters params = sslSocket.getSSLParameters();
params.setProtocols(new String[] {"TLSv1.2"});
sslSocket.setSSLParameters(params);

core-libs/java.io:

JDK-8290832: It is no longer possible to change "user.dir" in the JDK8
======================================================================
A change, JDK-8194154, was introduced in the 8u342 release of OpenJDK
causing the JDK to ignore attempts to set the `user.dir` property.
While this change is suitable for a major release (it was originally
introduced in the initial release of OpenJDK 11), changing the
behaviour of such a property in an update release creates
compatibility issues in software that relies on the behaviour in prior
versions of OpenJDK 8.  As a result, we have reverted this change in
8u345.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8215293: Customizing PKCS12 keystore Generation
===================================================
New system and security properties have been added to enable users to
customize the generation of PKCS #12 keystores. This includes
algorithms and parameters for key protection, certificate protection,
and MacData. The detailed explanation and possible values for these
properties can be found in the "PKCS12 KeyStore properties" section of
the `java.security` file.

Also, support for the following SHA-2 based HmacPBE algorithms has
been added to the SunJCE provider:

* HmacPBESHA224
* HmacPBESHA256
* HmacPBESHA384
* HmacPBESHA512
* HmacPBESHA512/224
* HmacPBESHA512/256

core-libs/java.io:

JDK-8285660: Enable Windows Alternate Data Streams by default
=============================================================
The Windows implementation of `java.io.File` has been changed so that
strict validity checks are **not** performed by default on file
paths. This includes allowing colons (':') in the path other than only
immediately after a single drive letter. It also allows paths that
represent NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS), such as
"filename:streamname". This restores the default behavior of
`java.io.File` to what it was prior to the April 2022 CPU in which
strict validity checks were not performed by default on file paths on
Windows. To re-enable strict path checking in `java.io.File`, the
system property `jdk.io.File.enableADS` should be set to `false` (case
ignored). This might be preferable, for example, if Windows special
device paths such as `NUL:` are *not* used.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

core-libs/java.net:

JDK-8164200: Modified HttpURLConnection behavior when no suitable proxy is found
================================================================================
The behavior of HttpURLConnection when using a ProxySelector has been
modified with this JDK release. HttpURLConnection used to fall back to
a DIRECT connection attempt if the configured proxy(s) failed to make
a connection. This release introduces a change whereby no DIRECT
connection will be attempted in such a scenario. Instead, the
HttpURLConnection.connect() method will fail and throw an IOException
which occurred from the last proxy tested.

security-libs/javax.net.ssl:

JDK-8219551: Updated the Default Enabled Cipher Suites Preference
=================================================================
The preference of the default enabled cipher suites has been
changed. The compatibility impact should be minimal. If needed,
applications can customize the enabled cipher suites and the
preference. For more details, refer to the SunJSSE provider
documentation and the JSSE Reference Guide documentation.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8256902: Removed Root Certificates with 1024-bit Keys
=========================================================
The following root certificates with weak 1024-bit RSA public keys
have been removed from the `cacerts` keystore:

Alias Name: thawtepremiumserverca [jdk]
Distinguished Name: EMAILADDRESS=premium-server@thawte.com, CN=Thawte Premium Server CA, OU=Certification Services Division, O=Thawte Consulting cc, L=Cape Town, ST=Western Cape, C=ZA

Alias Name: verisignclass2g2ca [jdk]
Distinguished Name: OU=VeriSign Trust Network, OU="(c) 1998 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only", OU=Class 2 Public Primary Certification Authority - G2, O="VeriSign, Inc.", C=US

Alias Name: verisignclass3ca [jdk]
Distinguished Name: OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority, O="VeriSign, Inc.", C=US

Alias Name: verisignclass3g2ca [jdk]
Distinguished Name: OU=VeriSign Trust Network, OU="(c) 1998 VeriSign, Inc. - For authorized use only", OU=Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority - G2, O="VeriSign, Inc.", C=US

Alias Name: verisigntsaca [jdk]
Distinguished Name: CN=Thawte Timestamping CA, OU=Thawte Certification, O=Thawte, L=Durbanville, ST=Western Cape, C=ZA

JDK-8261361: Removed Telia Company's Sonera Class2 CA certificate
=================================================================

The following root certificate have been removed from the cacerts truststore:

Alias Name: soneraclass2ca
Distinguished Name: CN=Sonera Class2 CA, O=Sonera, C=FI

security-libs/javax.net.ssl:

JDK-8257548: Improve Encoding of TLS Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Values
=========================================================================================
Certain TLS ALPN values couldn't be properly read or written by the
SunJSSE provider. This is due to the choice of Strings as the API
interface and the undocumented internal use of the UTF-8 Character Set
which converts characters larger than U+00007F (7-bit ASCII) into
multi-byte arrays that may not be expected by a peer.

ALPN values are now represented using the network byte representation
expected by the peer, which should require no modification for
standard 7-bit ASCII-based character Strings. However, SunJSSE now
encodes/decodes String characters as 8-bit ISO_8859_1/LATIN-1
characters.  This means applications that used characters above
U+000007F that were previously encoded using UTF-8 may need to either
be modified to perform the UTF-8 conversion, or set the Java security
property `jdk.tls.alpnCharset` to "UTF-8" revert the behavior.

See the updated guide at
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/jsse/alpn.html
for more information.

JDK-8244460: Support for certificate_authorities Extension
==========================================================
The "certificate_authorities" extension is an optional extension
introduced in TLS 1.3. It is used to indicate the certificate
authorities (CAs) that an endpoint supports and should be used by the
receiving endpoint to guide certificate selection.

With this JDK release, the "certificate_authorities" extension is
supported for TLS 1.3 in both the client and the server sides.  This
extension is always present for client certificate selection, while it
is optional for server certificate selection.

Applications can enable this extension for server certificate
selection by setting the `jdk.tls.client.enableCAExtension` system
property to `true`.  The default value of the property is `false`.

Note that if the client trusts more CAs than the size limit of the
extension (less than 2^16 bytes), the extension is not enabled.  Also,
some server implementations do not allow handshake messages to exceed
2^14 bytes.  Consequently, there may be interoperability issues when
`jdk.tls.client.enableCAExtension` is set to `true` and the client
trusts more CAs than the server implementation limit.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8260597: Added 2 HARICA Root CA Certificates
================================================

The following root certificates have been added to the cacerts truststore:

Alias Name: haricarootca2015
Distinguished Name: CN=Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions RootCA 2015, O=Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions Cert. Authority, L=Athens, C=GR

Alias Name: haricaeccrootca2015
Distinguished Name: CN=Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions ECC RootCA 2015, O=Hellenic Academic and Research Institutions Cert. Authority, L=Athens, C=GR

JDK-8236730: Weak Named Curves in TLS, CertPath, and Signed JAR Disabled by Default
===================================================================================
Weak named curves are disabled by default by adding them to the
following `disabledAlgorithms` security properties:

* jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms
* jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms
* jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms

Red Hat has always disabled many of the curves provided by upstream,
so the only addition in this release is:

* secp256k1

The curves that remain enabled are:

* secp256r1
* secp384r1
* secp521r1
* X25519
* X448

When large numbers of weak named curves need to be disabled, adding
individual named curves to each `disabledAlgorithms` property would be
overwhelming. To relieve this, a new security property,
`jdk.disabled.namedCurves`, is implemented that can list the named
curves common to all of the `disabledAlgorithms` properties. To use
the new property in the `disabledAlgorithms` properties, precede the
full property name with the keyword `include`.  Users can still add
individual named curves to `disabledAlgorithms` properties separate
from this new property.  No other properties can be included in the
`disabledAlgorithms` properties.

To restore the named curves, remove the `include
jdk.disabled.namedCurves` either from specific or from all
`disabledAlgorithms` security properties. To restore one or more
curves, remove the specific named curve(s) from the
`jdk.disabled.namedCurves` property.

JDK-8244286: Tools Warn If Weak Algorithms Are Used
===================================================
The `keytool` and `jarsigner` tools have been updated to warn users
when weak cryptographic algorithms are used in keys, certificates, and
signed JARs before they are disabled. The weak algorithms are set in
the `jdk.security.legacyAlgorithms` security property in the
`java.security` configuration file. In this release, the tools issue
warnings for the SHA-1 hash algorithm and 1024-bit RSA/DSA keys.

security-libs/javax.net.ssl:

JDK-8256490: Disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1
====================================
TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are versions of the TLS protocol that are no longer
considered secure and have been superseded by more secure and modern
versions (TLS 1.2 and 1.3).

These versions have now been disabled by default. If you encounter
issues, you can, at your own risk, re-enable the versions by removing
"TLSv1" and/or "TLSv1.1" from the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms`
security property in the `java.security` configuration file.

JDK-8242147: New System Properties to Configure the TLS Signature Schemes
=========================================================================
Two new system properties have been added to customize the TLS
signature schemes in JDK. `jdk.tls.client.SignatureSchemes` has been
added for the TLS client side, and `jdk.tls.server.SignatureSchemes`
has been added for the server side.

Each system property contains a comma-separated list of supported
signature scheme names specifying the signature schemes that could be
used for the TLS connections.

The names are described in the "Signature Schemes" section of the
*Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification*.

tools/javac:

JDK-8177368: Several incorporation steps are silently failing when an error should be reported
==============================================================================================
Reporting previously silent errors found during incorporation, JLS
8§18.3, was supposed to be a clean-up with performance only
implications. But consider the test case:

import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

class Klass {
  public static <A> List<List<A>> foo(List<? extends A>... lists) {
    return foo(Arrays.asList(lists));
    }

  public static <B> List<List<B>> foo(List<? extends List<? extends B>> lists) {
    return null;
  }
}

This code was not accepted before the patch for [1], but after this
patch the compiler is accepting it. Accepting this code is the right
behavior as not reporting incorporation errors was a bug in the
compiler.  While determining the applicability of method: <B>
List<List<B>> foo(List<? extends List<? extends B>> lists) for which
we have the constraints: b <: Object t <: List<? extends B> t<:Object
List<? extends A> <: t first, inference variable b is selected for
instantiation: b = CAP1 of ? extends A so this implies that: t <:
List<? extends CAP1 of ? extends A> t<: Object List<? extends A> <: t

Now all the bounds are checked for consistency. While checking if
List<? extends A> is a subtype of List<? extends CAP1 of ? extends A>
a bound error is reported. Before the compiler was just swallowing
it. As now the error is reported while inference variable b is being
instantiated, the bound set is rolled back to it's initial state, 'b'
is instantiated to Object, and with this instantiation the constraint
set is solvable, the method is applicable, it's the only applicable
one and the code is accepted as correct. The compiler behavior in this
case is defined at JLS 8 §18.4

This fix has source compatibility impact, right now code that wasn't
being accepted is now being accepted by the javac compiler. Currently
there are no reports of any other kind of incompatibility.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

core-svc/java.lang.management:

JDK-8236876: OperatingSystemMXBean Methods Inside a Container Return Container Specific Data
============================================================================================
When executing in a container, or other virtualized operating
environment, the following `OperatingSystemMXBean` methods in this
release return container specific information, if
available. Otherwise, they return host specific data:

* getFreePhysicalMemorySize()
* getTotalPhysicalMemorySize()
* getFreeSwapSpaceSize()
* getTotalSwapSpaceSize()
* getSystemCpuLoad()

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8250756: Added Entrust Root Certification Authority - G4 certificate
========================================================================
The Entrust root certificate has been added to the cacerts truststore:

Alias Name: entrustrootcag4
Distinguished Name: CN=Entrust Root Certification Authority - G4, OU="(c) 2015 Entrust,  Inc. - for authorized use only", OU=See www.entrust.net/legal-terms, O="Entrust, Inc.", C=US

JDK-8250860: Added 3 SSL Corporation Root CA Certificates
=========================================================
The following root certificates have been added to the cacerts truststore for the SSL Corporation:

Alias Name: sslrootrsaca
Distinguished Name: CN=SSL.com Root Certification Authority RSA, O=SSL Corporation, L=Houston, ST=Texas, C=US

Alias Name: sslrootevrsaca
Distinguished Name: CN=SSL.com EV Root Certification Authority RSA R2, O=SSL Corporation, L=Houston, ST=Texas, C=US

Alias Name: sslrooteccca
Distinguished Name: CN=SSL.com Root Certification Authority ECC, O=SSL Corporation, L=Houston, ST=Texas, C=US

security-libs/javax.crypto:pkcs11:

JDK-8221441: SunPKCS11 Provider Upgraded with Support for PKCS#11 v2.40
=======================================================================
The SunPKCS11 provider has been updated with support for PKCS#11
v2.40. This version adds support for more algorithms such as the
AES/GCM/NoPadding cipher, DSA signatures using SHA-2 family of message
digests, and RSASSA-PSS signatures when the corresponding PKCS11
mechanisms are supported by the underlying PKCS11 library.

security-libs/javax.security:

JDK-8242059: Support for canonicalize in krb5.conf
==================================================
The 'canonicalize' flag in the [krb5.conf file][0] is now supported by
the JDK Kerberos implementation. When set to *true*, RFC 6806 [1] name
canonicalization is requested by clients in TGT requests to KDC
services (AS protocol). Otherwise, and by default, it is not
requested.

The new default behavior is different from previous releases where
name canonicalization was always requested by clients in TGT requests
to KDC services (provided that support for RFC 6806[1] was not

JDK-8202891: Updated xmldsig Implementation to Apache Santuario 2.1.1
=====================================================================
The XMLDSig provider implementation in the `java.xml.crypto` module has been updated to version 2.1.1 of Apache Santuario.

New features include:

1. Support for the SHA-224 and SHA-3 DigestMethod algorithms specified
in RFC 6931.
2. Support for the HMAC-SHA224, RSA-SHA224, ECDSA-SHA224, and
RSASSA-PSS family of SignatureMethod algorithms specified in RFC 6931.

JDK-8238185: New OpenJDK-specific JDK 8 Updates System Property to fallback to legacy Base64 Encoding format
============================================================================================================
The upgrade to the Apache Santuario libraries (see above) introduced
an issue where XML signature using Base64 encoding resulted in
appending `&#xd` or `&#13` to the encoded output. This behavioural
change was made in the Apache Santuario codebase to comply with RFC
2045. The Santuario team has adopted a position of keeping their
libraries compliant with RFC 2045.

Earlier versions of OpenJDK 8 using the legacy encoder returns encoded
data in a format without `&#xd` or `&#13`.

Therefore a new system property, specific to the 8 update stream,
`com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.lineFeedOnly` is made
available to fall back to the legacy Base64 encoded format.

Users can set this flag in one of two ways:

1. -Dcom.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.lineFeedOnly=true

2. System.setProperty("com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.lineFeedOnly", "true")

This new system property is disabled by default. It has no effect on
default behaviour nor when
`com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.ignoreLineBreaks` property
is set.

Later JDK family versions will only support the recommended property:

`com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.security.ignoreLineBreaks`

JDK-8254177: US/Pacific-New Zone name removed as part of tzdata2020b
====================================================================
Following JDK's update to tzdata2020b, the long-obsolete files
pacificnew and systemv have been removed. As a result, the
"US/Pacific-New" zone name declared in the pacificnew data file is no
longer available for use.

Notes on individual issues:
===========================

hotspot/jfr:

JDK-8240687: JDK Flight Recorder Integrated to OpenJDK 8u
=========================================================

OpenJDK 8u now contains the backport of JEP 328: Flight Recorder
(https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/328) from later versions of OpenJDK.

JFR is a low-overhead framework to collect and provide data helpful to
troubleshoot the performance of the OpenJDK runtime and of Java
applications. It consists of a new API to define custom events under
the jdk.jfr namespace and a JMX interface to interact with the
framework. The recording can also be initiated with the application
startup using the -XX:+FlightRecorder flag or via jcmd. JFR replaces
the +XX:EnableTracing feature introduced in JEP 167, providing a more
efficient way to retrieve the same information. For compatibility
reasons, +XX:EnableTracing is still accepted, however no data will be
printed.

While JFR is not built by default upstream, it is included in Red Hat
binaries for supported architectures (x86_64, AArch64 & PowerPC 64)

hotspot/runtime:

JDK-8205622: JFR Start Failure After AppCDS Archive Created with JFR StartFlightRecording
=========================================================================================

JFR will be disabled with a warning message if it is enabled during
CDS dumping. The user will see the following warning message:

OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM warning: JFR will be disabled during CDS dumping

if JFR is enabled during CDS dumping such as in the following command
line:

$ java -Xshare:dump -XX:StartFlightRecording=dumponexit=true

security-libs/java.security:

JDK-8244167: Removal of Comodo Root CA Certificate
==================================================

The following expired Comodo root CA certificate was removed from the
`cacerts` keystore: + alias name "addtrustclass1ca [jdk]"

Distinguished Name: CN=AddTrust Class 1 CA Root, OU=AddTrust TTP Network, O=AddTrust AB, C=SE

JDK-8244166: Removal of DocuSign Root CA Certificate
====================================================

The following expired DocuSign root CA certificate was removed from
 the `cacerts` keystore: + alias name "keynectisrootca [jdk]"

Distinguished Name: CN=KEYNECTIS ROOT CA, OU=ROOT, O=KEYNECTIS, C=FR

security-libs/javax.crypto:pkcs11:

JDK-8240191: Allow SunPKCS11 initialization with NSS when external FIPS modules are present in the Security Modules Database
============================================================================================================================

The SunPKCS11 security provider can now be initialized with NSS when
FIPS-enabled external modules are configured in the Security Modules
Database (NSSDB). Prior to this change, the SunPKCS11 provider would
throw a RuntimeException with the message: "FIPS flag set for
non-internal module" when such a library was configured for NSS in
non-FIPS mode.

This change allows the JDK to work properly with recent NSS releases
on GNU/Linux operating systems when the system-wide FIPS policy is
turned on.

Further information can be found in JDK-8238555.

The SunRsaSign and SunJCE providers have been enhanced with support
for more algorithms defined in PKCS#1 v2.2, such as RSASSA-PSS
signature and OAEP using FIPS 180-4 digest algorithms. New
constructors and methods have been added to relevant JCA/JCE classes
under the `java.security.spec` and `javax.crypto.spec` packages for
supporting additional RSASSA-PSS parameters.

JDK-8227564: Allow SASL Mechanisms to Be Restricted
===================================================

A security property named `jdk.sasl.disabledMechanisms` has been added
that can be used to disable SASL mechanisms. Any disabled mechanism
will be ignored if it is specified in the `mechanisms` argument of
`Sasl.createSaslClient` or the `mechanism` argument of
`Sasl.createSaslServer`. The default value for this security property
is empty, which means that no mechanisms are disabled out-of-the-box.
